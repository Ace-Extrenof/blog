        <h1>My First Article!</h1>
        <p>This is the first article I have written here. I'm sure that means something, right? Okay maybe not, but who cares?</p>
        <p>I'm just a random kid on this land we pollute every day. Whether it means something or not, people don't care...</p>
        <p class="italic">That's how we're going to see our demise...</p>
        <p>Who said A.I will kill us? We will kill ourselves first before that!</p>
        <p>Okay, that's it. I don't have anything else to say.</p>
        <p>I hope I didn't waste your time too much...</p>
        <p class="italic">UNTIL WE MEET AGAIN</p>
